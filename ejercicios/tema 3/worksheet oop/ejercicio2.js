/*Write a Car class whose constructor initializes model and milesPerGallon from 
arguments.
All instances built with Car:
should initialize with a tank at 0
should initialize with an odometer at 0

Give cars the ability to get fueled with a .fill(gallons) method. Add the gallons to 
tank.

Give cars ability to .drive(distance). The distance driven:
Should cause the odometer to go up.
Should cause the the tank to go down taking milesPerGallon into account.

A car which runs out of fuel while driving can't drive any more distance:
The drive method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being 
odometer.*/

class Car {
    constructor(model,milesPerGallon) {
        this.model = model;
        this.milesPerGallon = milesPerGallon;
        this.tank = 0;
        this.odometer = 0;
    }

    fill(gallons){
        this.tank += gallons;
